title: New look -- Quarto
date: 2025-06-20

This blog has just undergone a refresh. I have been using [Quarto](https://quarto.org) for most of my writing, such as academic manuscripts, presentations,
and my PhD thesis. Naturally, I've been considering migrating this blog to Quarto
as well; I've finally bit the bullet. The migration process has been easy,
almost too easy. This really continues to cement my view that Quarto is the
perfect fit for modern technical writing, especially as unlike RMarkdown it is not
limited to R -- python is fully supported.

For readers of this blog, not much has changed... yet. However, this change will
hopefully allow me to post more (the publishing workflow is really easy),
and add more features such as email subscriptions.

More to follow..
