# Brief history of brucellosis

Described in many historical texts, all the way back to Hippocrates in 450 BC: 

> ”Protracted fevers accompanied by ‘tumours’ and joint aches” [@hippocratesEpidemics]

In 1751, Cleghorn describes intermittent tertian fevers in Minorca [@cleghornObservationsEpidemicalDiseases1749]. 

In 1859, Assistant Surgeon Jeffrey Allen Marston described his own symptoms of "Mediterranean remittent" fever: 

> There is no fever so irregular as this in its course and symptoms

Sir David Bruce, in 1886, visualised and isolated _Micrococcus melitensis_ from the spleen of a post-mortem patient: 

_"As it had been found by experiment that the air of the mortuary was peculiarly rich in germs ... I removed the spleen to a small room in my quarters, the door and window of which had been keep shut for some time"_ [@bruceNoteDiscoveryMicroorganism1887]

# Other important historical milestones

Development of serum agglutination method by Wright in 1897

Isolation of _M. melitensis_ from goats by Temi Zammit in 1905 


# Against all odds

Zammit's first attempt at investigated serostatus of 7 goats [@wyattHowThemistoclesZammit2005]: 

* all 7 were negative
* it is estimated that at the time, 50% of Maltese goats were positive
* odds of 7 negatives = 1:128

Repeated experiment in 1905 on 6 goats – 5 positive

Importantly, infected goats remained healthy

# Public health measures

Pasteurisation was not introduced until the late 1930

Public health measure to ban goat milk was put in place in 1906 (replaced with imported canned milk).

A milkman strike in protest of the measures likely contributed to disease control [@vassalloCorpsDiseaseBrucellosis1992].

# Bacteriology of _Brucella_ spp

* Gram negative coccobacillus
* Evolved from environmental soil organisms
* "Triple positive":
	* Oxidase positive
	* Catalase positive
	* Nitrate positive

# _Brucella_ colonies

# Pathogenesis and immunity

Intracellular survival protects organism: 

* therapeutics depend on antimicrobials with high intracellular concentrations
* long-term survival causes recurrence and treatment failure

Incomplete immunity

# Species

In 2020, the _Ochrobactrum_ genus was controversially assigned to the _Brucella_ genus [@morenoPathogenicityItsImplications2022]

Species | Preferred zoonotic host
-------------| ------------------
_B. melitensis_ | goats, camels 
_B. abortus_ | cattle
_B. suis_ | pigs
_B. canis_ | dogs
_B. ovis_ | sheep
_B. pinnipedialis_ | sea mammals

# Transmission and risk factors

Modality | Mechanism
--------------|---------
inhalation | aerosols
ingestion | dairy products
direct contact | inoculation/hypersensitivity
uncommon | human breast milk <br> sexual <br> blood transfusion <br> bone marrow transplant

# Clinical features of brucellosis in humans

Travel history is undoubtedly the most important question

Fever is the most important finding – classically undulating (waves) or remittent (comes and goes), although rarely seen

Musculoskeletal symptoms – differentiate febrile myalgia from localised bone and joint involvement

History may be long

Most patients are not severely unwell (if so, suggests infective endocarditis)

Any organ can be involved

# Undulant fever

[@hardyUndulantFeverSpecial1930]

![](images/image-30-x43-y316.png)

# Diagnosis – culture

Culture is unequivocal evidence of infection (i.e., _Brucellae_ do not colonise)

Blood culture: 

* sensitivity probably around 40-50%
* requirement for extended incubation times is less important if using automated incubator

Bone marrow has higher sensitivity – 60%

Other sites – joints, abscesses, etc.

Identification – MALDI-TOF is good, but defaults to _B. melitensis_

# Laboratory risk

Significant laboratory risk – probably the most important laboratory pathogen [@traxlerLiteratureReviewLaboratoryacquired2013]

Largest laboratory outbreak reported in Lanzhou, China (2019) [@pappasLanzhouBrucellaLeak2022]

>An inadequacy in sanitizing processes in a biopharmaceutical plant in Lanzhou, China, during July and August 2019, led to the aerosolization of Brucella that was subsequently spread through wind to nearby settlements and academic institutes, resulting in more than 10 000 human brucellosis cases...

> ...officials responsible for the leak have been identified and punished...

# Diagnosis – serology

Wright's Serum Tube Agglutination remains the gold standard test – unchanged for over 120 years

Procedure: 

* Set up serial dilutions of the test serum
* Add antigen (heated _B. abortus_) to tubes
* Incubate overnight
* Agglutinating serum forms clumps in the bottom of the tube
* Non-agglutinating serum remains cloudy, with no clumps

_B. canis_ lacks LPS, therefore needs specific serology

# Prozone effect

[@jinProzoneEffectDiagnosis2016]

![](images/image-3-x65-y517.png)

# Interpretation of serology tests

Variation between runs and interpreter – quality assurance is critical

Ideally demonstrate 4-fold increase in titre

An absolute cut-off is hard to define – certain titres may be tolerated in endemic areas

1:160 is the most agreed on cut-off

Other agglutination tests, e.g., Rose Bengal, work the same way

# Diagnosis – PCR

Around 80% sensitive

Useful, but beware of idiosyncratic prolonged positivity

# Case study

Clinical suspicion should be raised by presence of fever and travel to or residence in an endemic area (+/- consumption of high risk food)

Chronic infection and end organ involvement is challenging:

>53-year-old man presented (Saudi Arabia) with ankle pain and swelling. No fever, animal contact, raw milk consumption reported. Routine observations and bloods normal. X-ray of ankle normal. Brucella serology 1:160. Treated with oral flucloxacillin. Bone scan showed uptake in ankle and great toe. Blood cultures negative, but synovial fluid culture of ankle joint grew _B. melitensis_. Repeat serology 1:640

# Treatment

Susceptibility testing is not helpful, although note that _B. abortus_ live vaccine strain is inherently rifampicin resistant

Two agents minimum

Duration: 

* Uncomplicated/acute – 6 weeks
* Chronic/complicated – 12 weeks

# Antimicrobial agents

In order of likely efficacy: 

* doxycycline & streptomycin (or gentamicin)
* doxycycline & rifampicin
* doxycycline & co-trimoxazole

Children (under 8) and pregnancy – rifampicin & co-trimoxazole

# Global Impact

Brucellosis is likely to be the most common worldwide zoonotic disease

Although mortality rare, morbidity and loss of productivity due to illness is high

_Brucella canis_ will continue to be of increasing concern in Europe and US

Lanzhou outbreak shows why _Brucella_ spp continue to be recognised bioterrorism agents
