  abstract = {Objectives: The main clinical sequela of a lupus anticoagulant is increased thrombosis risk. However, bleeding due to lupus anticoagulant-hypoprothrombinemia syndrome is a rare but well-described manifestation of antiphospholipid syndrome. The association of acute acquired hypoprothrombinemia is caused by a lupus anticoagulant’s specificity to prothrombin, which results in clearance of prothrombin and bleeding due to hypoprothrombinemia (usually {$<$}10\% of normal). Severe life-threatening bleeding is most frequently reported in children with systemic lupus erythematosus or in healthy children after viral infection. In such cases, steroid therapy is usually effective in controlling the bleeding problems and improving prothrombin levels. Methods: We report one pediatric patient with a lupus anticoagulant who had acute hemorrhagic diathesis. Results: The diagnosis in this case was complicated by the presence of a prozone effect in lupus anticoagulant testing. The prozone effect (also known as hook effect) refers to situations where very high concentrations of antibody mask detection, typically in antigen-antibody reactions, which depend on visualization of agglutination. Decreasing the antibody/antigen ratio results in detectable antigenantibody complexes. Conclusions: We report for the first time a variation on this theme in a patient with a lupus anticoagulant-type antiphospholipid antibody and hypoprothrombinemia, which corrected with immunosuppression and restoration of normal prothrombin levels.},

  abstract = {Prevalence of brucellosis was studied in unvaccinated Changra goats in their native breeding tract of Changthang in the Indian Trans-Himalayan area of Ladakh which represents the western extension of the Tibetan Plateau, an important highland grazing ecosystem. A total of 680 serum samples were collected from 8 different areas including Kharnak, Sumdho, Chushul, Mughlib and Kargyam in the traditional Changra rearing belt, and Digger, Turtuk and Stakna in non-traditional belt. Brucellosis was diagnosed using serological tests viz RBPT, STAT, Dot-ELISA and Plate-ELISA, and serum based PCR. Apparent prevalence was calculated and true prevalence worked out on the basis of sensitivity and specificity for each test. The flock-level prevalence of brucellosis was 80\% to 100\%. The overall apparent prevalence by RBPT, STAT, Dot-ELISA, Plate ELISA and serum PCR, respectively was 24.85 (95\% CI 21.65-28.28), 13.97 (95\% CI 11.49-16.80), 26.03 (95\% CI 22.83-29.46), 12.21 (95\% CI 9.87-14.88) and 14.71 (95\% CI 12.15-17.54) and true prevalence worked out on the basis of sensitivity and specificity for each test was 29.45 (95\% CI 25.49-33.68), 23.16 (95\% CI 18.73-28.21), 18.38 (95\% CI 13.05-24.10), 17.19 (95\% CI 13.90-20.96) and 15.16 (95\% CI 12.53-18.08). The respective overall apparent and true prevalences were higher in traditional areas than in non-traditional areas.Prevalence was significantly (P≤0.05) higher in adult goats ({$>$}1 year) when compared with young ({$<$}1year). The present study revealed that brucellosis is prevalent in Ladakh region among changra goats and hence provides a source of zoonotic risk to the people rearing them because of intimate human-animal association.},

  abstract = {The intracellular pathogens of the genus Brucella are phylogenetically close to Ochrobactrum, a diverse group of free-living bacteria with a few species occasionally infecting medically compromised patients. A group of taxonomists recently included all Ochrobactrum organisms in the genus Brucella based on global genome analyses and alleged equivalences with genera such as Mycobacterium. Here, we demonstrate that such equivalencies are incorrect because they overlook the complexities of pathogenicity. By summarizing Brucella and Ochrobactrum divergences in lifestyle, structure, physiology, population, closed versus open pangenomes, genomic traits, and pathogenicity, we show that when they are adequately understood, they are highly relevant in taxonomy and not unidimensional quantitative characters. Thus, the Ochrobactrum and Brucella differences are not limited to their assignments to different “risk-groups”, a biologically (and hence, taxonomically) oversimplified description that, moreover, does not support ignoring the nomen periculosum rule, as proposed. Since the epidemiology, prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment are thoroughly unrelated, merging free-living Ochrobactrum organisms with highly pathogenic Brucella organisms brings evident risks for veterinarians, medical doctors, and public health authorities who confront brucellosis, a significant zoonosis worldwide. Therefore, from taxonomical and practical standpoints, the Brucella and Ochrobactrum genera must be maintained apart. Consequently, we urge researchers, culture collections, and databases to keep their canonical nomenclature.},

No recent reviews have addressed the characteristics of laboratory-acquired brucellosis (LAB). English-language literature was reviewed to identify reports of laboratory exposures to Brucella spp. and LAB cases between 1982 and 2007. Evaluation of 28 case reports identified 167 potentially exposed laboratory workers, of whom 71 had LAB. Nine reports were identified that summarized an additional 186 cases of LAB. Only 18 (11\%) exposures were due to laboratory accidents, 147 (88\%) exposures were due to aerosolization of organisms during routine identification activities, and the circumstances of 2 (1\%) exposures were unknown. Brucella melitensis was the causative agent in 80\% (135/167) of the exposures. Workers with high-risk exposures were 9.3 times more likely to develop LAB than workers with low-risk exposures (95\% confidence interval [CI], 3.0 to 38.6; P {$<$} 0.0001); they were also 0.009 times likelier to develop LAB if they took antimicrobial PEP than if they did not (95\% CI, 0 to 0.042; P {$<$} 0.0001). The median incubation period in case and summary reports was 8 weeks (range 1 to 40 weeks). Antimicrobial PEP is effective in preventing LAB. The incubation period may be used to identify appropriate serological and symptom surveillance time frames for exposed laboratory workers.},

  abstract = {The disease we now know as brucellosis was first discovered in the 1850s in Malta. It came to the attention of British medical officers serving on the island after the Crimean War. It was easy to eliminate the disease in British servicemen, but very difficult to reach Maltese citizens. Over the decades, more and more Maltese were infected as the control measures introduced were half-hearted and were often not even enforced. The work of Dr Themistocles Zammit showed that infected goats transmitted brucellosis and that banning use of their milk would be effective. Pasteurisation was not introduced onto the island until the 1930s, when the production of cheap, small sterile containers became possible. Transmission was also possible through sexual contact and by inhalation when people were crowded in hot airless conditions. Success in controlling the disease requires sensible, strict control of animals and the elimination of infected ones, but will fail without an educated public willing to help. In Malta, failure to control rogue flocks and small flocks kept for family use led to an epidemic caused by the sale of cheeselets (small cheeses). In 2005, nearly a century after Zammit’s discovery, Malta was finally free of brucellosis.},
