    "text": "I believe there is a list of bacterial pathogens which are really true classics of the bacteriology field. They have a rich historical background and knowledge of these diseases has evolved in such a way over the past ~100 years that every bacteriologist must have a good understanding of them. Currently, my list stands as follows:\n\nMycobacterium tuberculosis\nTreponema pallidum (syphilis)\nBrucella melitensis (brucellosis)\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\n\nI have kept this list purposefully austere, and will admit bacteria over time, if they have done enough to pass the strict admission criteria.\nBacteriologists have known about the pneumococcus since 1881, when Sternberg and Pasteur independently described it in the US and France respectively (in the same year). The story of Sternberg’s discovery is particularly appealing. He was working on finding the cause of malaria and one of his experiments involved injecting rabbits with swamp samples from New Orleans. For these experiments, he also injected “control rabbits” with his own saliva. Much to his surprise, these control rabbits rapidly died a horrible death in 48 hours (I will need to dig up his original reports to see what happened to the rabbits injected with swamp fluid). He must have been fascinated by this surprise discovery, as he went on to titrate the concentration of saliva that caused rabbit death (1.25c3 to 1.75c3 injected subcutaneously). He also demonstrated that the diplococcic pneumococcus was the cause of death.\nThe pneumococcus has many features that I argue warrant its admission to this small list of pathogens:\n\nit remains well identified using basic good old-fashioned bacteriological techniques (which are perhaps better in some ways than modern techniques)\nmodern medicine has had a great impact on infection over the last century through various different therapies and vaccination\nit is a multisystem pathogen, that disseminates haematogically and forms biofilm\nthere is a complex interplay between the germ and the body’s immune response, ranging from colonisation to fatal infection\n\nWe rightfully think of penicillin as having revolutionised treatment of pneumococcal infection. Mortality after meningitis was 100%, while pneumococcal pneumonia caused death in 35% of infected patients. The success of penicillin in driving down mortality overshadows the reality that successes were achieved prior to widespread use of penicillin. Sulfonamides (which unfortunately are hindered by frequent emergence of resistance during therapy) and concentrated rabbit serum (these rabbits have really had a bad time with the pneumococcus) were deployed with success. Violini et al reported in 1941 mortality rates of 9.8% and 5.3% for serotherapy and sulfonamide chemotherapy respectively, compared with 38.4% for control cases.\nThe pneumococcus also has an important contribution to the field of antimicrobial resistance, but an unexpected one. While the development of resistance to penicillin is the most important development in the clinical practice and treatment of pneumococcus, the pneumococcus was the first bacterium to which antimicrobial resistance was described. The agent was optochin, and resistance was described in 1912. Curiously this agent still has an important use in the laboratory - susceptibility to optochin is used as a quick and dirty way to identify Streptococcus pneumoniae (ironically!). It has no clinical uses nowadays.\nI welcome nominations for bacteria to admit to this prestigious list. I will attempt to follow this article up with polemics for the others that are currently on it.\nI close with this excellent quote:\n\nPneumococcus is an altogether amazing cell. Tiny in size, simple in structure, frail in make-up, it possesses physiological functions of great variety, performs feats of extraordinary intricacy and, attacking man, sets up a stormy disease so often fatal that it must be reckoned as one of the foremost causes of human death. Furthermore, living or dead, whole or in part, on entering the animal body, Pneumococcus starts a train of impulses, stimulating all reactions grouped under those inclusive phenomena known as immunity.\n\nBenjamin White, The Biology of Pneumococcus, 1938\nFurther reading:\nAustrian, R., 1999.

To use remote R through RStudio, start a terminal session, log into the remote environment through SSH, and activate R. Then use control + option + enter to dispatch lines of code, instead of control + enter.\nVSCode in general is much better suited for integrated remote developmnet, and when set up can be very seamless. I’ll be exploring how well this can be extended to R. I’ll also need to use R within a conda environment so additional work is needed.\nThe official documentation helps get us started.\n\nEnsure that you have a conda environment with R installed\nInstall languageserver using install.packages(\"languageserver\") in the loaded conda environment R.

    "text": "Introduction\nThe aim of this brief document is to summarise some general principles that allow the reader to identify acquired resistance mechanisms in Enterobacterales. For the purpose of this document this shall include organisms such as E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp, Enterobacter spp, etc but importantly it will not extend to the nonfermenters (Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia). This is not meant to be an exhaustive document - there exist other excellent papers that go into more detail, such as:\n\nCMR review on AmpC beta-lactamases\nCMR review on ESBLs\nEUCAST Resistance mechanisms\n\nSome notes on treatment options are also included, although again this is not meant to be an exhaustive list.\n\n\nExtended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)\nKnowing the definition of ESBL gets us halfway towards understanding how best to detect them. ESBLs are defined as:\n\na group of β-lactamases which share the ability to hydrolyse third-generation cephalosporins and aztreonam yet are inhibited by clavulanic acid.\n\nTherefore this explains the use of Cefpodoxime as a screening test for ESBLs. The definitive phenotypic test is synergy testing with a beta-lactamase inhibitor. The principle behind these tests is important.\n\nScreening tests\nA third generation cephalosporin disc is the most sensitive and convenient. Cefpodoxime performs this role best.\n\n\nGenotypic tests\nThere are some genotypic ESBL tests available. For example, some of the various Biofire Filmarray products can detect CTX-M. The main issue is that there are many different types and variations of ESBL (CTX, TEM, SHV, OXA-types), therefore the utility of a CTX-M PCR depends on whether this is the predominant gene in the tested population.\n\n\nPhenotypic tests\nThese are probably the most useful confirmatory tests for ESBLs.\nEnterobacterales that do not produce ESBL have a particular MIC or disc zone to third-generation cefalosporins. This is not affected by the presence of clavulanic acid.\nEnterobacterales that do produce ESBL show (as per the original definition) a reduction of MIC (or increase in zone size) when the third-generation cefalosporin is combined with clavulanic acid.\n\n\nOther tests\nA chromogenic cefalosporin colorimetric test is available as a screening test, and follows the same principles as the chromogenic cefalosporin test for beta-lactamase detection in Staph. aureus.\n\n\n\nAmpC beta-lactamases\nThe first point to make, and perhaps the most important, is that there are two types of AmpC beta-lactamases that we need to be concerned with:\n\nChromosomal AmpC - these can be produced constitutively by certain bacterial species (such as Enterobacter spp., C. freundii, M. morganii, P. aeruginosa). These organisms in effect always have the ability to produce AmpC beta-lactamase through de-repression. Therefore whenever we isolate these organisms, we should assume that they can produce AmpC beta-lactamases, and should ignore any other results such as Cefoxitin susceptibility.\n\n\nAn interesting question - does E. coli have a chromosomal AmpC?\n\n\nAcquired (usually plasmid mediated) AmpC - these have a similar effect to the above, but are acquired by bacterial species that otherwise do not have a chromosomal AmpC (organisms such as Klebsiella spp.). For these we do need further testing to determine their abscence or presence.\n\nAll the points below only apply to acquired AmpC.\n\nScreening tests\nCefoxitin is the most useful screening antibiotic for AmpC. However while it is very sensitive, it is not particularly specific, as there are other mechanisms of resistance against this antibiotic (such as porin loss). Therefore, we should also look at Cefotaxime and/or Ceftazidime. We should expect that if there is an acquired AmpC (rather than porin loss against Cefoxitin) that there is resistance to one of these agents as well.\nIn many laboratories, this is really where the AmpC story ends. Trying to confirm acquired AmpC further is high effort (especially as many isolates also co-produce ESBL) with low clinical yield, so many do not bother.\nIn summary (where “X” = any result):\n\n\n\nOrganism\nCefoxitin\nCefotaxime/Ceftazidime\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n\nHas chromosomal AmpC\nX\nX\nAmpC positive\n\n\nDoes not have chromosomal AmpC\nS\nX\nAmpC negative\n\n\nDoes not have chromosomal AmpC\nR\nS\nAmpC negative\n\n\nDoes not have chromosomal AmpC\nR\nR\nAmpC positive\n\n\n\n\n\nGenotypic tests\nPCR for different AmpC enzymes is available, but not in common routine use. Look elsewhere if you are curious.\n\n\nPhenotypic tests\nFor exam purposes, it is worth mentioning that AmpC are inhibited by cloxacillin, giving similar results to the ESBL synergy tests if using cloxacillin instead of clavulanic acid, which is in theory a confirmatory test.\n\n\n\nCarbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE)\nThis is a heterogenous group, and impossible to cover completely. Remember also that other mechanisms (such as AmpC de-repression with porin loss) are important causes of carbapenem resistance. It is however possible to learn a few tricks to distinguish between the 5 main classes:\n\nOXA-48\nKPC\nMetallo-beta-lactamases (MBL):\n\nVIM\nNDM\nIMP\n\n\nFortunately if we group the metallo-beta-lactamases together we only have to deal with 3 groups (in the laboratory and even clinically VIM/NDM/IMP behave very similarly).\n\nScreening tests\nErtapenem is the most sensitive antibiotic for CPE screening. Any zone smaller than 25mm in a suspect organism should be investigated further. Meropenem can also be used (better specificity at the cost of sensitivity).\n\n\nPhenotypic tests\nUntil a few years ago, the Modified Hodge test was used as a phenotypic test for CPE. Thankfully (as this test is a bit tricky to explain) it is no longer recommended, due to poor performance.\nSynergy tests can be used to identify CPE, and are quite popular exam questions:\n\nSynergy with boronic acid - KPC (although be aware that this also applies to AmpC)\nSynergy with dipicolinic acid (DPA) or EDTA - MBL\nOXA-48 does not exhibit synergy with any agent\n\n\n\nGenotypic tests\nThese are by far the most practically useful tests to confirm the presence of CPE. Cepheid Xpert Carba-R detects the 5 main CPE classes quickly and with good results.\n\n\nOther tests\nIt is possible to use colorimetric tests and even MALDI-TOF for the detection of CPE. However it is unlikely that these tests would appeal to a laboratory that has genotypic methods available.\nIs it possible to summarise ESBL/AmpC/CPEs in one table? Yes, but at what cost?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMechanism\nSynergy\nAntibiotic hints\nBeta-lactam treatment options\n\n\n\n\nESBL\nClavulanic acid ( + 3rd gen cefalosporin)\nCefpodoxime R  Cefepime R\nMeropenem  Ertapenem  Temocillin  Ceftazidime-avibactam  Ceftolozane-tazobactam\n\n\nAcquired AmpC\nBoronic acid or cloxacillin (+ 3rd gen cefalosporin)\nCefoxitin + Ceftazidime/Cefotaxime R  Cefepime S\nSimilar to ESBL\n\n\nKPC\nBoronic acid (+ carbapenem)\n\nMeropenem-vaborbactam  Ceftazidime-avibactam  Imipenem-relebactam  Cefiderocol\n\n\nOXA-48\nNone\nHigh level Temocillin R  Ceftazidime S\nCeftazidime-avibactam  Ceftazidime  Cefiderocol\n\n\nMBL\nDPA/EDTA (+ carbapenem)\nAztreonam S\nAztreonam-avibactam  Aztreonam  Cefiderocol\n\n\n\nImportant- this table does not apply if there are multiple resistance mechanisms.\nThis table does not include non-beta-lactam classes of antibiotics, which can be used depending on susceptibility testing and source of infection. These agents, if sensitive, include:\n\nquinolones\naminoglycosides\npolymixins\ntigecycline\nco-trimoxazole\nchloramphenicol\n\n\n\n\nConclusion and unanswered questions\nThere remain many unanswered questions in this field:\n\nCan we use piperacillin-tazobactam to treat ESBL/AmpC? MERINO trial suggests not, at least for “definitive” therapy\nShould we give combination therapy to all patients with invasive CPE infection, even if sensitive to one of the new beta-lactams? (probably, since resistance during treatment can occur with agents such as ceftazidime-avibactam)\nShould we care about colonisation detected on IPC screens in patients who are unwell?\n\nIt is also worth reviewing acquired colistin resistance (mcr genes) altough this seems to have gone quiet recently - possibly due to the introduction of new Gram-negative antibacterial agents having been released."

It was of a novel class - a glycylcycline. Even two decades later, we still do not know how it should be pronounced. We think of it as similar to tetracyclines. The timing of its introduction is important. It came at a time when the new antimicrobial pipeline was considered “dry”. It also came with much promise - on paper (or in vitro) it demonstrated a very broad spectrum of activity against all sorts of bacteria. It appears to have some sort of sentience and awareness of bacterial taxononomic names, since it is has poor efficacy against bacteria that start with P, such as the pseudomonads. Otherwise, one could say that it gave hope that novel class broad-spectrum agents could still be developed."

    "section": "Where are we now",
    "text": "Where are we now\nTigecycline has had a mixed couple of decades. On the one hand, it has a well established niche in the management of intra-abdominal infections, and has a bit part role in prominent guidelines for the treatment of such infections. It also enjoys licences for skin and soft tissue infection and community-acquired pneumonia.\nThe flip side is a lot more ominious. Despite multiple studies showing non-inferiority to comparatory antimicrobials in the pre-approval stage, a later meta-analysis of trial data showed an increased all-cause mortality in the tigecycline group. This led to a black box warning, and understandably, reluctance to use in severe infections. However, as is often the case when heterogenous data is re-analysed, a later meta-analysis did not show a statistically significant increased mortality risk when tigeycyline is used for its approved indications.\nThe reported increased mortality, alongside the fact that serum levels of tigecycline during therapy are low, and its bacteriostatic mode of action, have led to an almost universal reluctance to use tigecycline monotherapy for pretty much any sort of infection. This is particularly so for patients who have concominant bacteraemia. Most infection specialists would always combine tigecycline with another agent (or use another agent altogether) in bacteraemic patients, regardless of source. It is assumed that tigecycline is an ineffective choice in bacteraemia - although evidence may suggest otherwise. I am not sure it is fair to assume that low serum levels will lead to treatment failure in patients with bacteraemia. Most patients have “secondary” bacteraemia, caused by some focal source. In a way, the bacteraemia is merely a symptom of the true problem, albeit one that we can easily measure. Particularly for intra-abdominal infections, the high tissue concentrations of tigecycline means that it is treating infection at its source. The killing of bacteria while they are circulating in blood seems a secondary concern to me. Indeed distant site dissemination with such infections is almost unheard of."

It’s reputation has been clouded by arbitrary non-inferiority thresholds and post-hoc analyses - with what appears to be a bias to overstate negative results and ignore positive ones. It’s relatively (in antimicrobial timelines) recent introduction into clinical use means that it has been subject to strict analysis and critical appraisal - and rightly so. There are many older antibiotics in routine use that have never been subjected to such investigation. One wonders what results we would find if those hypothetical trials were done. We sometimes go through such acrobatics to come up with complex regimes (particularly in the presence of penicillin allergy), often with toxic agents, just to avoid using agents such as tigecycline.\nTherefore, I designate Tigecycline a Misunderstood Antibiotic, it’s use limited by collective practice and opinion. The evidence behind such beliefs now fades into legend. We must all now combine tigecycline with another agent, regardless of the situation in which it is used.\nNote: this article is an opinion piece and has not been peer-reviewed.

The number of publications reflect this, with a sustained interest in the antibiotic since around 2005. Our next step is to repeat this step for every possible antibiotic. Firstly we need a list of all antibiotics, which is coveniently in one of the AMR package datasets:\nAMR::antibiotics$name %&gt;% head %&gt;% print\n## [1] \"4-aminosalicylic acid\" \"5-fluorocytosine\"      \"Acetylmidecamycin\"    \n## [4] \"Acetylspiramycin\"      \"Aldesulfone sodium\"    \"Amikacin\"\nAMR::antibiotics$name %&gt;% length %&gt;% print\n## [1] 456\nWe’ve got 456 agents listed here. Next we’ll need to expand the dataframe with information about whether each agent is detected in the title text. This can get a bit messy because a publication can have multiple (or none) agents. I’m sure there must be a more elegant way to do this (please comment below!) but I have gone for a brute additional boolean column for each agent using a for-loop.\nfor(i in AMR::antibiotics$name){\n  out &lt;- str_detect(data$title, fixed(i, ignore_case = T))\n  out &lt;- list(out)\n  names(out) &lt;- i\n  data &lt;- bind_cols(data, out)\n}\nNow for each agent we have a boolean column telling us whether the agent was detected in the title. This is computationally slow, but once we have the data we can pivot into a longer layout for further analysis.\ndata_long &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = AMR::antibiotics$name, names_to = \"antibiotic\")\nWe now have a dataframe with a row for each antibiotic for each study with a logical value of whether the antibiotic was detected. This will allow us to easily analyse the data. Many of these agents are very obscure, so let’s start by getting a list of the top 20 antibiotics (by publications).\ntop_20_abx &lt;- data_long %&gt;%\n  group_by(antibiotic) %&gt;%\n  filter(value == TRUE) %&gt;% \n  summarise(n = n()) %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(n)) %&gt;% \n  slice_head(n = 20) %&gt;% pull(antibiotic)\nprint(top_20_abx)\n##  [1] \"Methicillin\"    \"Vancomycin\"     \"Ofloxacin\"      \"Ciprofloxacin\" \n##  [5] \"Colistin\"       \"Linezolid\"      \"Fluconazole\"    \"Tetracycline\"  \n##  [9] \"Daptomycin\"     \"Tigecycline\"    \"Amphotericin B\" \"Rifampicin\"    \n## [13] \"Clarithromycin\" \"Isoniazid\"      \"Levofloxacin\"   \"Erythromycin\"  \n## [17] \"Azithromycin\"   \"Gentamicin\"     \"Meropenem\"      \"Imipenem\"\nThese are all recognisable agents - no major suprises here. We can now use this data to plot trends in publications for individual agents over time.\ndata_long %&gt;% \n  filter(antibiotic %in% top_20_abx) %&gt;% \n  filter(value == TRUE) %&gt;% \n  group_by(antibiotic, year) %&gt;% \n  summarise(pubs = n()) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = pubs)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~ antibiotic)\n\n\n\nTrends for publications of the top 20 mentioned antibiotic agents\n\n\nTwo antibiotics stand out. Publications on colistin have been steadily increasing over the past ~10 years. This is not surprising and reflects the emergence of carbapenem-resistant bacteria, which has reignited interest in this old antibiotic. I imagine that interest will plateau over the next few years, reflecting the release of alternative agents with activity against carbapenem-resistant bacteria.\nAnother old agent which appears to have re-emerged (and plateaued) is methicillin. This probably reflects interest in MRSA rather than the agent itself. We may get a better idea of trends by log scaling the y-axis.\ndata_long %&gt;% \n  filter(antibiotic %in% top_20_abx) %&gt;% \n  filter(value == TRUE) %&gt;% \n  group_by(antibiotic, year) %&gt;% \n  summarise(pubs = n()) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = pubs)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~ antibiotic) +\n  scale_y_log10()\n\n\n\nTrends for publications of the top 20 mentioned antibiotic agents (log scale)\n\n\nMost trends are quite stable. Antimicrobials released within the observed time frame reveal quite an interesting trend - publications peak relatively quickly and are then quite stable. Some other trends are also interesting, such as a steady increase in rifampicin. The slope of this is quite similar to isoniazid. This suggests that most of these publications are related to TB. A (not too scientific way) to visualise this could be a word cloud."

    "text": "Conclusion\nPublication trends seem to reveal changes in academic interest for certain antibiotics. The results suggest also appear to reflect growing concern on certain AMR pathogens such as Cabapenem Resistant Enterobacteraceae, MDRTB, MRSA, etc. Relatively novel antimicrobials released within the data period appear to reach peak interest and plataeu quite quickly.
